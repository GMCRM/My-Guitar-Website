-- Blog Images Storage Setup
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to set up blog image storage

-- 1. First, make sure blog_posts table has image_url column
ALTER TABLE blog_posts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS image_url text;

-- 2. Create storage bucket for blog images (this might fail if bucket already exists - that's OK)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'blog-images', 
  'blog-images', 
  true,
  10485760, -- 10MB in bytes
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp']
) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- 3. Enable Row Level Security on storage.objects (should already be enabled)
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 4. Create policies for blog images storage

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Blog images are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can upload blog images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can update blog images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can delete blog images" ON storage.objects;

-- Policy for public read access to blog images
CREATE POLICY "Blog images are publicly accessible" 
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'blog-images');

-- Policy for admin upload
CREATE POLICY "Admin can upload blog images" 
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'blog-images' 
  AND (auth.jwt() ->> 'email' = 'grantmatai@gmail.com' OR auth.role() = 'service_role')
);

-- Policy for admin update
CREATE POLICY "Admin can update blog images" 
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'blog-images' 
  AND (auth.jwt() ->> 'email' = 'grantmatai@gmail.com' OR auth.role() = 'service_role')
);

-- Policy for admin delete
CREATE POLICY "Admin can delete blog images" 
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'blog-images' 
  AND (auth.jwt() ->> 'email' = 'grantmatai@gmail.com' OR auth.role() = 'service_role')
);

-- 5. Verify setup
SELECT 
  'Blog images storage setup complete' as status,
  'Bucket: ' || name as bucket_info,
  'Public: ' || public::text as public_access,
  'File limit: ' || (file_size_limit / 1024 / 1024)::text || 'MB' as size_limit
FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE id = 'blog-images';

-- Check that image_url column exists
SELECT 
  'blog_posts table ready' as table_status,
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'blog_posts' AND column_name = 'image_url';

-- List storage policies for blog-images bucket
SELECT 
  'Storage policies:' as info,
  policyname,
  cmd,
  permissive
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'storage' 
  AND tablename = 'objects' 
  AND (policyname LIKE '%blog%' OR policyname LIKE '%Blog%');
