     Hello everyone! Back here with another post. This here is my Yamaha Classical guitar. Classical guitar is an articulate and flowy genre. I first started playing the classical guitar when I was in 9th grade in highschool. It quickly became a passion of mine, and I jumped head first into the large databases of classical guitar tabliture.

      Hello everyone! My name is Matai. This is my first Blog post here on my website. How exciting! As you may be able to tell,  I am majoring in CIT (Computer
      Information Technology) and made this website. I am a <strong>Guitarist/Youtuber</strong>. I love
      classical guitar, as well as singing. I served a mission in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."
        >Washington, D.C.</a
      >
      from January 2018 - January 2020. I am from Washington state, though I
      lived in Middle Tennessee for 6 years growing up. --Nashville is where I
      bought my first guitar-- I am excited to learn more about Web Design! I
      have always had a love for Technology, and I have always been a visually
      creative person, so I am greatly looking forward to the chance to learn
      how to make some websites! Anyways, I have high hopes of growing my still
      young Youtube Channel, so if you like music and want to see my future content then please consider checking out
      my channel, and do me a solid by subscribing. :-)
